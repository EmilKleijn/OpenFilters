# OpenFilters
** Through a pull-request, I discovered the [web-page still exist](https://www.polymtl.ca/larfis/en/links), and was just not found by me. This project is archived. 
You can download the source from there. Please do so instead. Also there is an executable to be found.
**

This is **non-offical** copy of the source archive delivered with the OpenFilters software, currently at version 1.1.1.
This is the official [Homepage](https://www.polymtl.ca/larfis/en/links).

They only things added by me are the README file and the LICENSE file.
